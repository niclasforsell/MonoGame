   Welcome to your new MonoGame for PS4 project!

   Before you build and run this solution there are a few manual steps you have to make:

     1. You need to set the "Project Dependencies" so that the C++ Launcher 
	    project is dependent on the C# $safeprojectname$ project.

     2. You need to set the C++ Launcher as the "Startup Project".

     3. You need to verify that the Debugging "Working Directory" on the C++ Launcher project to $(TargetDir).

  Note that this project is dependent on having the PlayStation and Mono.PS4 SDKs 
  installed on your machine.  We have some introductory information on the wiki that 
  walks you thru these steps:
