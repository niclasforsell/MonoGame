Welcome to the MonoGame game library documentation hub.

### WORK IN PROGRESS
Note that the MonoGame documentation project is currently a work in progress.

You can also reference our [GitHub wiki](http://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki) and the original [Codeplex documentation](http://monogame.codeplex.com/documentation) while we're getting this all sorted out.

### We need help writing the MonoGame documentation!
As you know, documentation is what separates good open source projects from forgotten ones and as it stands the MonoGame documentation is only a little way to being great. If we all band together, we can make it great!

This is call out to all MonoGame developers willing to help if you have tutorials, code snippets, experience with the various platforms, youtube videos or any other form of documentation. Let's gather it all together in one place and make MonoGame even better.

The docs are editable by everyone. Check out the README.md file here:

https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/tree/develop/Documentation

Since it works via GitHub it allows us to officially review all docs before submission and lets us version the docs along with the code changes.

So for example the tutorials page is here:

https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/Documentation/tutorials.md

You can edit it right from the GitHub UI in your own fork and get a pretty WYSIWYG experience.
